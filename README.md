### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am lawyer by training and junior web developer by passion, systematically programming, on both front- and back-end stack since 2020. For a long time Iâ€™ve been fascinated by the endless possibilities of the IT world, dipping my toes into office software applications in the roles of a tester, which ignited my passion for the field. Last year, I began a nine-month-long Web Development Bootcamp, a very intense and practice-oriented course that equipped me with essential knowledge to start my new journey. I'm an ambitious, highly motivated and hard-working person, eager to learn new technologies and open to new challenges. Through my previous work experience, I proved myself to be a reliable, well-organized and stress-resistant team-player with strong interpersonal skills. Iâ€™d be happy to use all my assets in the role of a junior programmer.
